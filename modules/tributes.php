<p>Donald Miller was many things to many people. This section of the website contains mostly content developed at the time of Don's death: the tributes presented at his funeral&sbquo; articles about his contributions to politics&rsquo; the arts and science&sbquo; and the words that people wrote about him in the condolences to his wife and family.</p><hr /> 
<p><b>A few of many tributes from friends:</b></p>
<p>"Bold, incisive, direct, thoughtful, persistent, courageous, -- all words that apply to my thinking about Don. Friends remember his humor and amazing ability to listen and then concisely respond to others. I know that Don will be missed and remembered. His name and memories of him will come up many, many times in coming years." -- Pat Mann</p>

<p>"I have known Don for fifty years now since first meeting him in the Chemistry Department in 1962. I have known him as a selfless person, an excellent chemist, an environmentalist, a champion of art and music, and a politically active citizen who loved Livermore very much. I learned much about civic government from him and admired his active role in fostering open space which is dear to my heart. He loved his family and was very proud of each of you. Miriam, you were always first in his thoughts. I will always remember him as a true friend." - Jean Rozsnyai</p>

<p>"Grit is variously defined as courage and resolve; strength and firmness of character; indomitable spirit; pluck; perseverance and passion for long term goals. No matter which of the attributes and characteristics one chooses to focus on, each and every one applies to Don. He was Mr. True Grit: How appropriate for True Grit to be the last film that Don would ever watched. 
Obviously Grit alone does not define the man we knew and loved: For us, the Lee family, Don was first and foremost a Friend - a loyal, reliable, constant friend. Don and Miriam rallied to our side to offer help with every challenge, and to celebrate every milestone and each triumph!" -- Day and Maria Lee</p><hr />

<p>Former Livermore Mayor Don Miller, a respected physical chemist whose tireless civic activism helped shape the face of the city, died of cancer Friday morning. He was 84.</p><p>"We can thank Don for a lot of things we hold precious," said Michael Ferrucci, Miller's friend and political ally. "He was a spokesperson for generations. He's going to be missed by a lot of people."</p><p>Miller, who was born and raised in Oakland, earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry from UC Berkeley in 1949, and a Ph.D. from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, in 1952. In 1956, he began a 45-year career at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.</p><p>When developers began to salivate over the bucolic town of Livermore in the early 1960s, Miller felt the need to get involved. He told the story in a 2006 edition of the Sierra Club Yodeler:</p><p>"In the early '60s, a lot of us got tired of seeing developers bamboozle earlier city councils," he wrote. "By the '70s, air pollution got bad, water was close to being rationed, the sewer plant was at capacity. A lot of us became involved in trying to make the community environmentally conscious and to change the political situation."</p><p>From 1964 through 1976, Miller served on the planning commission and City Council, acting as mayor in 1973-74. He also he became involved in such organizations as Save All Valley Environments, Citizens Alliance for Public Planning and Citizens for Balanced Growth.</p><p>"Certain people think he's a hero, and certain people think he's the biggest villain who ever lived," said Doug Mann, a friend who served with Miller on the board of Citizens for Balanced Growth. "From his point of view, you can always build another house. But you can't take one down if you put it in the wrong place. He was very cautious, to me, and that's OK in a world where a lot of decisions are made too cavalierly."</p><p>Current Livermore Mayor John Marchand credits Miller for inspiring him to get involved in politics.</p><p>"Don Miller did not compromise," Marchand said. "He would dig in and work very hard for what he believed in."</p><p>Marchand cited the 2002 initiative for an urban growth boundary as an example of Miller's determination to do what he believed to be the right thing for the city.</p><p>"He helped gather 10,000 signatures, and the council adopted it," Marchand said of the initiative that protects open space in north Livermore. "The importance of that is that in 2005, when Measure D came on the ballot, the first vote to reaffirm it, 72 percent of voters voted to uphold the urban growth boundary that was put in place by a citizens initiative."</p><p>Added Ferrucci, "People would say that growth is inevitable. Don's response to that was, 'What's the rush?' "</p><p>"If it weren't for Don Miller," Mann said, "I believe Livermore would look a lot more like Los Angeles today."</p><p>Miller is survived by his wife of 62 years, Miriam; daughter Nancy Lindeman and her husband, Ralph; daughter Lynne Franco and her husband, Ciro; and two grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, the family requests contributions in his memory be made to Congregation Beth Emek in Pleasanton and the Bankhead Theater in Livermore.</p><hr />
