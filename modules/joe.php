		<p><b>A Tribute by Joseph A. Rard, Chemistry colleague from LLNL</b></p>

				<div>Don Miller received a B.S. degree in chemistry from the University of California (Berkeley) in 1949 &sbquo; which was 
						
						followed by a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from the University of Illinois (Urbana/Champaign) in 1952. His Ph.D. mentor was 
						
						Prof. Frederick T. Wall and his thesis topic was the statistical thermodynamics of rubber. There was a large amount of 
						
						interest in the properties of rubbers at that time &sbquo; to a large extent motivated by the need during World War II to 
						
						create synthetic rubber after the major source of natural rubber &sbquo; the rubber plantations in Malaysia &sbquo; became 
						
						unavailable to the Western allies.<br />
				        After completing his Ph.D. Don spent the following two years as an Assistant Professor at the University of Louisville 
						
						(Louisville &sbquo; Kentucky) &sbquo; followed by two years at Brookhaven National Laboratory where he worked with Dr. Simon 
						
						Freed on the spectroscopy of rare earth ions (europium and gadolinium) in water and alcohol solutions. <br />
	                    In 1956 Don came to work at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in Livermore &sbquo; California &sbquo; which had been 
						
						founded in 1952. This laboratory was subsequently renamed Lawrence Livermore Laboratory and later Lawrence Livermore National 
						
						Laboratory (LLNL) and was managed by the University of California until September 30 &sbquo; 2007. This laboratory will be 
						
						referred to below simply as LLNL. <br />
				        Don spent the remainder of his scientific career at LLNL &sbquo; retiring in 1991. His decision to retire at that time 
						
						was not an easy one &sbquo; and was motivated by a financial inducement by the University of California to encourage early 
						
						retirement. However &sbquo; since Don was still interested and active in scientific research &sbquo; he continued at LLNL as 
						
						a Participating Guest for many years &sbquo; showing up at his office nearly as often as before his retirement. After Don 
						
						&rsquo;s brother Stanley Miller suffered a severe and debilitating stroke &sbquo; Don spent significantly less time at LLNL 
						
						as he and Miriam made numerous trips to southern California to help with his brother &rsquo;s care and affairs.<br />
				        In addition to his scientific work at LLNL &sbquo; Don took several sabbatical leaves as a Fulbright Professor (Facultés 
						
						Catholiques de Lille &sbquo; France) &sbquo; a Research Fellow (Australian National University &sbquo; Canberra &sbquo; 
						
						Australia) &sbquo; a Contract Professor (Università degli Studi di Napoli – Federico II &sbquo; Italy) &sbquo; Guest 
						
						Professors (Technische Hochschule &sbquo; Aachen &sbquo; Germany; Universitat de València &sbquo; Spain) &sbquo; and an 
						
						Adjunct Professor (Texas Christian University &sbquo; USA). At these institutes he gave lectures on the thermodynamics of 
						
						linear irreversible processes and the Onsager reciprocal relations &sbquo; and was engaged with collaborative research with 
						
						scientists at these institutes. It should be noted that a Fullbright professorship is a very prestigious position.<br />
				        Don &rsquo;s early interests included Boolean algebra and equations of state of gases &sbquo; but soon turned to the 
						
						thermodynamics of linear irreversible processes and the Onsager reciprocal relations that had been put on a firm theoretical 
						
						foundation largely by the work of Prof. Lars Onsager. Onsager &rsquo;s derivation of the reciprocal relations (ORR) &sbquo; 
						
						which provide symmetrical relations among experimental quantities involving coupled transport processes &sbquo; resulted in 
						
						his Nobel Prize. <br />
				        Meanwhile &sbquo; Prof. Louis Gosting and his students at University of Wisconsin (Madison) had built &sbquo; calibrated 
						
						&sbquo; and tested an optical interferometer for studying diffusion in liquid solutions resulting from concentration 
						
						differences across a boundary &sbquo; which will be referred to as the Gosting diffusiometer. This instrument was and still 
						
						is the most accurate one for determining this type of diffusion coefficient. Don pointed out to Gosting that his measured 
						
						diffusion coefficients for 3-component systems &sbquo; when combined with appropriate thermodynamic quantities &sbquo; 
						
						provided a fairly sensitive test of one of the ORRs. Don subsequently published a paper with Laurie Woof and Louis Gosting 
						
						testing the ORR for several different solution compositions.<br />
				        In 1966 and 1967 Don published three important and influential review papers in the Journal of Physical Chemistry that 
						
						collected together the equations for thermodynamics of linear irreversible thermodynamics (that were taken from a variety of 
						
						publications spread out over the scientific literature) &sbquo; supplemented the derivations where needed &sbquo; and 
						
						provided tables of critically assessed transport coefficients and tests of the ORR for a variety of aqueous mixtures. At that 
						
						time &sbquo; long before the era of personal computers &sbquo; printed reprints of publications were purchased from the 
						
						publisher and sent out by regular mail. The demand for reprints of these three papers was so heavy that special permission 
						
						had to be obtained from the publisher (the American Chemical Society) in order to print extra copies at LLNL needed to fill 
						
						all of the reprint requests. Don also published two thorough reviews of experimental evidence for the validity of the ORRs 
						
						(1960 &sbquo; 1974). These articles helped to stimulate much renewed interest in linear irreversible thermodynamics and the 
						
						ORR and established Don as an expert in these subjects. <br />
				        John G. Albright &sbquo; who did his Ph.D. research in Prof. Louis Gosting &rsquo;s laboratory &sbquo; joined the 
						
						Chemistry Department faculty at Texas Christian University in Ft. Worth &sbquo; Texas in the autumn of 1966 where his 
						
						research involved diffusion and other related properties. Around 1970 he spent several months with Don Miller at LLNL. They 
						
						obtained an electrophoresis apparatus from the Biochemistry Department where it was no longer being used for such 
						
						measurements &sbquo; reset the optical components to convert it into a diffusiometer for studying liquid mixtures &sbquo; and 
						
						performed measurements for several aqueous systems. Lee Eppstein &sbquo; who received his Ph.D. from TCU under the mentorship 
						
						of Prof. Albright &sbquo; later helped Don Miller replace the original lenses with lenses of higher quality and realign the 
						
						instrument to optimize the quality of the measured diffusion data. Diffusion had by then become one of Don Miller &rsquo;s 
						
						major scientific interests and remained so for the remainder of his career. <br />
				        When I started graduate school the employment situation was so good that people receiving their Ph.D. in any branch of 
						
						chemistry were pretty much guaranteed at least three job offers upon graduation. However &sbquo; by the time I received my 
						
						Ph.D. in early 1973 the job market had reversed due to large-scale layoffs in the chemical industry &sbquo; and few graduates 
						
						received job offers. I did what was common then &sbquo; and still is in this situation &sbquo; and accepted a postdoctoral 
						
						fellowship position (Ames Laboratory &sbquo; then an Energy Research and Development Administration laboratory). In 1976 the 
						
						person whom I was working for (Prof. F. H. Spedding) received a call from Don Miller looking for a postdoc to make diffusion 
						
						coefficient measurements at LLNL. Don had a previous postdoc (Michael Pikal) from the laboratory of Prof. Spedding &sbquo; 
						
						who had done excellent work &sbquo; so Don called him first. Having already spent three years as a postdoc at Ames Laboratory 
						
						I knew it was time to move on and broaden my experience. The following day I mailed a letter to Don Miller to apply for this 
						
						postdoctoral position &sbquo; was accepted &sbquo; and in mid December 1976 my wife Deb and I arrived in Livermore. After 
						
						completing this two year postdoctoral position &sbquo; with Don &rsquo;s help I was able become an employee of LLNL where I 
						
						remained for another 28.5 years. <br />
				        In addition to measuring diffusion coefficients &sbquo; I also obtained some equipment from Ames Laboratory (three 
						
						chambers for isopiestic measurements) for thermodynamic measurements needed for the analysis of diffusion data. I especially 
						
						enjoy doing experiments in the laboratory and don &rsquo;t mind doing the literature searches associated with the research 
						
						and writing the papers for publication. However &sbquo; I am unenthusiastic about doing the necessary data smoothing 
						
						(&quot;number crunching &quot;) and calculations. Although Don was quite capable of making high quality laboratory 
						
						measurements &sbquo; he was far less enthusiastic about this than I &sbquo; and was happy to do the data analysis. By pooling 
						
						our talents and abilities &sbquo; together we were able to measure and publish a far larger body of high quality experimental 
						
						diffusion and thermodynamic data that would have possible had we been working separately. Our collaborations continued even 
						
						after our retirements; our most recent paper (with Prof. John Albright) was published in 2009 in a special issue honoring the 
						
						famous solution chemist Prof. Robin Stokes on his 90th birthday. <br />
				        I counted Don &rsquo;s and my joint publications and went through my fingers and toes twice &sbquo; 41 joint 
						
						publications in peer-reviewed journals. Prof. John Albright of TCU is probably a close second in the number of joint 
						
						publications with Don Miller &sbquo; many also involving me. Don also published with many other scientists &sbquo; especially 
						
						various scientists at the diffusion laboratory at the Università degli Studi di Napoli – Federico II in Italy. <br />
				        Prof. Louis Gosting &sbquo; who with his students build the Gosting diffusiometer mentioned earlier &sbquo; died shortly 
						
						after it was built and calibrated. His research associate &sbquo; Dr. Hyoungman Kim &sbquo; continued the use of this 
						
						instrument for another year &sbquo; but when the research grant expired &sbquo; Dr. Kim returned to his native South Korea. 
						
						The diffusiometer saw only occasional use after that and ended up in the laboratory of Prof. Gerson Kegeles (Prof. Louis 
						
						Gosting &rsquo;s Ph.D. mentor). When Prof. Kegeles was near to retirement there was a high probability that this 
						
						diffusiometer and associated equipment would be  &quot;cannibalized &quot; for its parts and the rest discarded unless a new 
						
						home was found for it. Don Miller was unwilling to let the best-of-its-kind instrument be destroyed &sbquo; and spent many 
						
						hours on the telephone calling other scientists trying to find a new home for the Gosting diffusiometer but without success. 
						
						Fortunately &sbquo; Don was then able to convince Dr. Cristopher Gatrousis &sbquo; at that time head of Nuclear Chemistry at 
						
						LLNL &sbquo; to provide a double sized laboratory needed for this huge instrument. I very well remember the day in March 1981 
						
						when the Gosting diffusiometer was delivered to LLNL. I was supposed to have helped unpack and sort the equipment &sbquo; but 
						
						that was the day our daughter &sbquo; Elizabeth &sbquo; chose to see the rest of the world so I was otherwise occupied at a 
						
						hospital. <br />
				        The next few years were very productive &sbquo; with most of the diffusion experiments being made for a very thorough 
						
						study of the diffusion coefficients of mixtures of sodium chloride and magnesium chloride in water as part of an 
						
						International Collaboration to determine the thermodynamic and transport properties of this system. Many of the diffusion 
						
						measurements were made by two hard-working and competent graduate students &sbquo; Roy Mathew (an immigrant from India) from 
						
						Prof. Albright &rsquo;s laboratory at TCU &sbquo; and Luigi (Gino) Paduano from Prof. Vincenzo Vitagliano &rsquo;s laboratory 
						
						at Università degli Studi di Napoli – Federico II &sbquo; as part of their Ph.D. thesis research. We were at times assisted 
						
						by Catherine M. ( &quot;Terry &quot;) Lee &sbquo; a very bright high school student &sbquo; now Catherine Hough &sbquo; MD. 
						
						Unfortunately &sbquo; after several years we lost the laboratory space to a better-funded project and the diffusiometer and 
						
						its associated equipment were put into storage. <br />
				        By 1991 it was quite clear that we would not be able to obtain a large enough replacement laboratory at LLNL &sbquo; and 
						
						the Gosting diffusiometer was shipped to our colleague Prof. John Albright at Texas Christian University &sbquo; which has 
						
						become its permanent home. Since Prof. Albright &rsquo;s retirement it has been under the stewardship of Prof. Annunziata 
						
						Onofrio &sbquo; with much of the research now involving biochemical systems containing proteins. Until its arrival at TCU 
						
						&sbquo; data collection from the diffusiometer was made by the traditional method of photographs on glass plates &sbquo; 
						
						which required careful at tedious measurements of the information needed to calculate the diffusion coefficients. Around the 
						
						time of the Gosting &rsquo;s diffusiometer arrival at TCU &sbquo; the son of a professional colleague of Don Miller &rsquo;s 
						
						from Germany (Prof. Manfred Zeidler) &sbquo; Manfred E. Zeidler &sbquo; received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering. The 
						
						unification of Germany had recently happened and &sbquo; because of the resulting economic flux &sbquo; jobs for recent 
						
						graduates were very scarce. With Don &rsquo;s encouragement &sbquo; Dr. Manfred E. Zeidler came to TCU (with support from his 
						
						father) &sbquo; where he automated data collection for the Gosting diffusiometer to  &quot;real time &quot; using an array of 
						
						light-sensitive diodes. Data collection for this instrument is now computer controlled &sbquo; resulting in more data being 
						
						collected and consequently more precise diffusion coefficients. <br />
				        In addition to the scientific work already described &sbquo; Don and his collaborators were involved in research with 
						
						many other aspects of classical (equilibrium) thermodynamics and the thermodynamics of linear irreversible processes &sbquo; 
						
						including new methods of data analysis &sbquo; new methods for estimating these properties for mixtures &sbquo; and different 
						
						theoretical models. <br />
				        In addition to his extensive work in solution chemistry &sbquo; Don had an interest in the history of science &sbquo; in 
						
						particular the work of French scientist Pierre Duhem and Nobel Prize winner Lars Onsager. Pierre Duhem (1861–1916) was a 
						
						physicist &sbquo; mathematician &sbquo; historian of science &sbquo; and philosopher of science. Don felt that Pierre Duhem 
						
						&rsquo;s scientific accomplishments had not been adequately appreciated and wanted to set the record straight. As part of his 
						
						research Don interviewed Pierre Duhem &rsquo;s elderly daughter and obtained copies of many unpublished letters and 
						
						photographs. See &sbquo; for example: http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Pierre_Maurice_Marie_Duhem.aspx. Lars Onsager was a 
						
						Norwegian scientist that spent most off his career at universities in the USA. Lars Onsager was known both for the brilliance 
						
						and originality of his scientific work and his inability to present the results at a level that most other scientists could 
						
						understand. As already mentioned above &sbquo; Don was interested in Onsager &rsquo;s work mainly because of his fundamental 
						
						contributions to the thermodynamics of linear irreversible processes and the derivation of the Onsager reciprocal relations. 
						
						Quite by accident &sbquo; in 1978 Don encountered Prof. Lars Onsager in the badge office at LLNL &sbquo; managed to locate a 
						
						tape recorder &sbquo; and got Onsager to assess his scientific accomplishments in terms of their relative importance. This 
						
						was the last interview with Onsager &sbquo; who died a few months later. Don published a summary of this interview in the 
						
						Journal of Statistical Physics &sbquo; volume 78 &sbquo; pp. 563–573 (1995).<br />
				        In addition to his research already mentioned &sbquo; Don also published numerous papers in ballistics &sbquo; including 
						
						some on  &quot;rifle twist &quot;.<br />
				        Several months ago &sbquo; after Don &rsquo;s health had deteriorated and he knew that he could no longer continue his 
						
						scientific research &sbquo; he recruited me to  &quot;tie up the loose ends &quot;. Don had been trying to help an elderly 
						
						&sbquo; retired &sbquo; German professor complete two papers involving diffusion and transference numbers &sbquo; and he 
						
						recruited me to finish these two papers. I have since rewritten both of these papers. There are also two of our joint papers 
						
						that need to be written &sbquo; also involving Prof. John Albright of TCU &sbquo; to finish up the work of the International 
						
						Collaboration on the transport and thermodynamic properties of mixtures sodium chloride and magnesium chloride in water. I 
						
						brought home several boxes of computer output &sbquo; preliminary calculations &sbquo; hand drawn plots &sbquo; 
						
						correspondence &sbquo; etc. &sbquo; related to these two planned papers. Thus Don should have at least two more (posthumous) 
						
						publications in solution chemistry.<br />
