<p><b>History of Science</b></p>
<p>Don Miller was very interested in various aspects of the history of science. Fascinated by the scientific work and life of French scientist Pierre Duhem (1861-1916), he researched, wrote and published several articles about Duhem. During his Fulbright Fellowship in France, he got the rare opportunity to interview Duhem's only daughter.</p>
<p>He also published articles about Nobel Prize winner Lars Onsager's role in the development of the thermodynamics of linear irreversible processes. Onsager's Nobel Prize address included comments on Don's contributions to Irreversible Processes.</p> 
<p>And, several of his articles about ballistics included a focus on the biographies of historical figures in the area.</p>
