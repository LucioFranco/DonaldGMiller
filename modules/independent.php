has been said that the Tri-Valley environmental movement was born in Miller's
living room in the early 1960's. After helping to elect several like-minded
citizens to Livermore's city council in 1972, he was instrumental in launching
the SAVE initiative in Livermore, a measure that blocked development unless
adequate services were identified. His efforts, and those of others, culminated
in the adoption of the Alameda County urban growth boundary (UGB) in 2000 and
the Livermore UGB two years later. The first threat to the UGB was rebuffed in
2005, when Miller and his allies defeated the <span class=SpellE>Pardee</span>

an accomplished pianist. He composed Centennial Rag, a ragtime piano tune, in
celebration of Livermore's Centennial. He, along with a few others founded the
Livermore Cultural Arts Council in the 1960's, which recognized him and King
