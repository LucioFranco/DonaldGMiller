<div>Donald G. Miller knew he wanted to be a chemist from the time he was 13 years old, and he spent the better part of the rest of his life doing just that. <br><br>
With a BS with Honors in Chemistry from University of California, Berkeley, and a Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Illinois, he spent the next 60 years as a research chemist, a professor and an historian of science.  Most of his work was in the thermodynamics of irreversible processes, but he also counted among his almost 130 published papers ones on a wide variety of other topics in chemistry and mathematics.  Most of his career was at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, but he taught and did research around the world.
