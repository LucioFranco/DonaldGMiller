<div><b>Don and Family</b><br /><br /></div> 
<div>Don viewed &quot;family&quot; in a broad sense. His first family was his wife and two daughters whom he adored. However&sbquo; his concept of family also incorporated his grandchildren (whom he also adored)&sbquo; his close relatives, and all the generations before him. He felt connected to them all. He loved stories about the previous generations&sbquo; and also wanted to know the latest about what was happening in the lives of those close to him. <br /><br />

He was extremely proud of his wife Miriam's accomplishments; he alsways strongly encouraged her activities, even when it meant that he was going to have to take over some of the household responsibilities. <br /><br /> 

He was happy when he could talk to each family member individually&sbquo; but he also was satisfied if he only heard the details second hand&sbquo; usually in reports from Miriam. What he didn&rsquo;t like was to be left out of the family loop. <br /><br />

He loved being a grandparent, and he was a wonderful one.  His grandchildren, Elena and Lucio Franco, were the light of his life. <br /><br />

Don was not much interested in playing games except for poker which he taught his children and grandchildren.  His interest in sports was limited to swimming&sbquo; sailing&sbquo; and shooting. The only team sporting event he paid any attention to was the "Big Game" - the annual Cal-Stanford football game. When asked what he did for fun. He usually answered&sbquo; &quot;My work is my fun!&quot; <br /><br /></div>
