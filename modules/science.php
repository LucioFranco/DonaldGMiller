<div><b>Donald Miller as a Chemist</b> <br /><br /></div>
<div>Donald G. Miller knew he wanted to be a chemist from the time he was 13 years old&sbquo; and he spent the better part of 

the rest of his life doing just that. <br /><br />
He received his B.S. with honors from the University of California&sbquo; Berkeley in Chemistry in 1949. His Ph.D. came from 

the University of Illinois three years later&sbquo; in 1952&sbquo; with a thesis on the statistical thermodynamics of rubber. 

<br /><br />
He spent two years as an assistant professor of chemistry at the University of Louisville&sbquo; where he published the first 

of his almost 130 articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals. He followed that with a post-doctoral fellowship at the 

Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York. <br /><br />
From there&sbquo; he returned to his California roots&sbquo; working as a senior research chemist for the rest of his career 

at what is now the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory&sbquo; in Livermore&sbquo; CA. During the more than 50 years that 

he was affiliated with the &quot;Lab&sbquo;&quot; he also spent time at universities and laboratories in France&sbquo; 

Italy&sbquo; Germany&sbquo; Australia&sbquo; and Spain&sbquo; as well as in Wisconsin and Texas. And&sbquo; in 1960-61&sbquo; 

he had a prestigious Fulbright Teaching Fellowship at the Universite de Lille and the Faculties Catholique in Lille&sbquo; 

France. <br /><br />
Although his first published papers involved Boolean algebra&sbquo; hiss focus soon moved to the thermodynamics of linear 

irreversible processes&sbquo; where he first made his name with a series of articles in the American Journal of Physics. This 

was followed by articles laying out the proof of the Onsager Reciprocal Relations&sbquo; including an article Lars Onsager 

himself cited when he won the Nobel Prize. The Onsager Reciprocal Relations provide symmetrical relations among experimental 

quantities involving coupled transport processes. <br /><br />
Among the many topics on which Don Miller published scientific papers were: <br /><br />
* thermodynamics of rubber<br /> 
* Boolean algebra<br />
* the spectroscopy of trivalent rare earth ions in aqueous and alcoholic solutions <br />
* equations of state of gases <br />
* experimental binary and multi-component solution diffusion coefficient measurements <br />
* experimental binary and multi-component solution osmotic coefficient measurements<br /> 
* experimental binary and multi-component solution density and partial molar volume measurements <br />
* experimental transference number and electrical conductivity measurements<br /> 
* calculation of Onsager transport coefficients&sbquo; velocity correlation coefficients&sbquo; and distinct diffusion 
coefficients<br /> 
* comparison of binary-solution-based mixing rules for thermodynamic and transport properties using different composition 

scales<br /> 
* convective (gravitational) instabilities resulting from multi-component diffusion; extending methods for analyzing Rayleigh 
and Gouy interferometric diffusion data to higher-order mixtures<br />

* basing multicomponent diffusion on thermodynamics of linear irreversible processes&sbquo; <br />
* comparing different reference frames for describing diffusion and transport processes. <br /><br />

In addition&sbquo; Don Miller published in the history of science&sbquo; especially on the life and scientific achievements 

of Pierre Duhem&sbquo; a French scientist that he thought had been unfairly ignored&sbquo; and on Lars Onsager&rsquo;s role 

in the development of thermodynamics of linear irreversible processes. <br /><br />
