<p><b>Tribute by Marshall Kamena&sbquo; Former Mayor of Livermore</b></p><br />

<div>I have been fearing this day since attending Gib Marguth&rsquo;s funeral. I am here today to rejoice in the memory of my 

friend and mentor&sbquo; Dr. Donald G. Miller. You should know two little tidbits he told me in absolute confidence. I will 

share that confidence with all of you now. His middle name is Gabriel. His initials are DGM. He wished that they had been 

reversed to MGD. That means Millions of Gallons per Day. Amongst all his other talents he was a sewer expert&sbquo; 

too.<br /><br /> 

You all know that he has been a person of many abilities. God granted immense talent to Don; and Don never did anything half 

way. He did&sbquo; however&sbquo; have a deviated little finger on one hand. He often said that if he ever pointed it at 

someone&sbquo; he did so when he did not think enough of that person to send the very best! Don was a scientist&sbquo; 

musician&sbquo; composer&sbquo; pianist&sbquo; harpsichordist&sbquo; elected official&sbquo; planning commissioner&sbquo; 

city councilman&sbquo; Mayor and thespian. He was a perfectionist with a memory that never forgot. Don could resume a 

conversation (debate) with a colleague or one of the &quot;black hats&quot; exactly where it left off&sbquo; even if it were 

a year later. Few people will ever have the abilities we all saw in this dedicated man. I thought he was a genius. Almost no 

one has doubted that. <br /><br />

It was a common practice for Don to write a political position paper or letter twice. The first one let him get out all his 

criticisms. The second one was for publication and more discreet. He always said&sbquo; &quot;This one is my stand on the 

issue&sbquo; and this one is Miriam&rsquo;s revision.&quot; <br /><br />

He and I enjoyed some special connections with each other and they will transcend time. His father&sbquo; Nathan 

Miller&sbquo; was the Senior Assistant District Attorney in the office of Earl Warren in Alameda County. My Dad&rsquo;s uncle 

Platt served in that courtroom as its Senior Court Recorder. In those days the recorder also had to be an attorney. 

Also&sbquo; Don&rsquo;s extended family left an oppressive 
old-country to seek freedom in America. His father was devoted to maintaining the laws of a civilized society&sbquo; and 

could do that here. My father went back to the seat of dissent in Germany and spent six years reducing the common enemy 

there. <br /><br />

There have been two particular threads that bound Don and me. We have had a deep respect for the rights&sbquo; not 

privileges&sbquo; bestowed on Americans by the Second Amendment. Historically where weapons have been denied the common 

citizen&sbquo; those societies have lost millions of people at the hands of the government. Don was also a life member of the 

NRA&sbquo; the National Rifle Association&sbquo; and the Second Amendment Foundation. One of my most recent memories of Don 

was this summer when I met him at our Livermore shooting range. He was a sharpshooter. He was sighting-in a new Savage Arms 

Co. rifle for his grandson. &quot;Marshall&sbquo;&quot; he said&sbquo; &quot;If you see his mother&sbquo; don&rsquo;t mention 

this episode. She has not yet matured in her thinking about firearms&sbquo; even though we would be slaves today without 

them.&quot; <br /><br />

As an aside I want to mention that in 2001 I formed a group called LCOM. That means the Livermore Council of Mayors. We had 7 

living past Mayors of Livermore at that time. We met quarterly to exchange ideas and advice. For the holidays in December I 

had golf shirts made with the Livermore City logo on each&sbquo; and personalized them. Don&rsquo;s shirt was made to his 

rather slight measurements and said &quot;Mayor Emeritus&quot; on the chest. All the other Mayors were quite happy to receive 

their shirts. Don refused&sbquo; saying that he never accepted a dime of city funds while in office and was not going to 

start now! A few weeks ago I had to move from the Mayor&rsquo;s office to a slightly smaller one on the other side by the 

City Manager. In my bottom drawer still in the festive bag was Don&rsquo;s shirt with the tags still in place. I will leave 

that shirt here today for that grandson to cherish. <br /><br />

Don was a ballistics expert and collector of historically important firearms. He authored more than 35 masterful and 

scholarly papers published in the important applicable journals. In 2004-2005 I was privileged to witness his derivation of a 

new mathematical law in this field. It beautifully exposed the forces in play called the &quot;gyroscopic stability 

factors&quot; of bullets as they leave the business end of a rifle&sbquo; the muzzle. He demonstrated how one could calculate 

the necessary physical factors to produce the ideal bullet projectile for the purpose at hand. For Don there needed to be 

some practical value as a result of his research. <br /><br />

In 1977 he started to wear trifocals. Desktop computers might get popular. After I examined his eyes he was nice enough to 

write the prescription for me with instructions to the optical laboratory as to what radius of curvature was required. He 

even solved the astigmatism problems. I was afraid he was going to send me a bill. <br /><br />

The second deep tie for us has always been local government. Don Miller believed deeply in maintaining an elevated quality of 

life for our Livermore residents. He felt that if we could codify those elements that pursue this objective&sbquo; those laws 

would demonstrably become a wonderful legacy from the authors to Livermore posterity. He was correct. &quot;His focus 

throughout was on ensuring that Livermore remained a livable city&sbquo; with clean air&sbquo; open space&sbquo; parks&sbquo; 

and a pleasant and aesthetically pleasing downtown area with cultural spaces.&quot; He&sbquo; against all odds&sbquo; passed 

the sign ordinance to limit the classless size and clutter of billboards&sbquo; garish downtown business signs and the like. 

That rule still persists. &quot;He and his political allies also fought against high-density development&sbquo; and are 

considered responsible for the limits on that development along the Livermore Valley ridge lines.&quot; It is called the 

Scenic Corridor Ordinance. The ultimate validation to Don came on December 16&sbquo; 2002. The Urban Growth Boundary became 

law. It set the stage for the beautiful new downtown we now enjoy&sbquo; with the iconic Bankhead Performing Arts Theater. 

<br /><br />

He will also be remembered for his earlier work with his friends on the SAVE initiative (Save All Valley Environments). His 

wonderful comrades and contributors&sbquo; Drs Clarence Hoenig&sbquo; Bob Seldon&sbquo; Clyde Taylor&sbquo; Archer 

Futch&sbquo; Helen Tirsell&sbquo; Marj & Herman Lieder&sbquo; John Pitts&sbquo; Gloria Taylor&sbquo; Joan Kinney Seppala and 

others produced and upheld precedent setting work. They &quot;wrote the first book&quot; on this issue. The 

&quot;residentialists&quot; showed the dissidents that local manifest destiny attempts had to equilibrate environmental and 

educational factors to control unrestrained development. &quot;You shouldn&rsquo;t build any more houses if you cannot supply 

water&sbquo; sewer or schools to the residents&sbquo;&quot; said Don. It seems so intuitive and correct today&sbquo; but in 

the late 60&rsquo;s it was heresy. <br /><br />

Dr. Miller had about 143 rules he composed for governent officials at the local level. I cannot remember all of them the way 

Mayor Marchand does. However&sbquo; I remember well two of them dealing with city council issues: &quot;Three votes is 

power&quot; and &quot;Winning is better than losing&quot;. He also had some &quot;Millerisms&quot; on sustaining a happy 

marriage. I&rsquo;ll leave that for another day and for the experts. <br /><br />

Don left formal city council service in March of 1976. So did Archer Futch. For some this was the end of an enlightened era. 

For me it was an opportunity to be an apprentice to the master of debate and accomplishment. I took his seat on the 

council&sbquo; but could not presume to take his place. His base of operations&sbquo; however&sbquo; merely changed from City 

Hall to anyplace where a phone was available. <br /><br />

For over thirty of the following years I have felt very fortunate particularly because of two things. The first is his 

April&sbquo; 1976 comment to Helen Tirsell&sbquo; the first woman Mayor of Livermore&sbquo; that Kamena looks OK&sbquo; but 

we&rsquo;re going to need to watch him&sbquo; for he comes from the Chamber of Commerce crowd. In the many years that 

followed he paid me the ultimate compliment. He said I voted &quot;right&quot; on the important issues. <br /><br />

Secondly&sbquo; and maybe because we were both &quot;Old Blues&quot; from Berkeley&sbquo; or perhaps for some unexplained 

reasons such as respect and affection&sbquo; Don and I never ever had an argument. <br /><br />

If any of you wish to know more about Don Miller just google his name. Inexplicably the following appears: <br /><br /></div>
