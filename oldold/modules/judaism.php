<div><b>Don and Judaism</b><img src="/images/donandtorah.jpg" width="143" height="211" style="float:right;"/><br /><br /></div>
<div>Don was born a Jew&sbquo; attended Sunday School&sbquo; had a Bar Mitzvah&sbquo; and had friends who went to fight fought in the 1948 war between Israel and the Arabs. He gave little thought to the content of Judaism until he had a father-in-law who was a Conservative Rabbi. The two of them spent many hours over a number of years discussing whether a Jew had to believe in God&sbquo; whether the rituals were alive today&sbquo; and the effect of the Holocaust on the continuance of Judaism. <br /><br />
Don always defined himself as an &quot;agnostic with atheist tendencies&quot;. He educated his children in the Jewish tradition while having little involvement himself. As time went on&sbquo; and after many discussions&sbquo; he came to believe that the most effective way for Judaism to continue in America was with strong synagogues that provided community&sbquo; education&sbquo; and an understanding that the ethical traditions provided the best guide to living your life. <br /><br />
He provided wise counsel to the leadership&sbquo; and made his particular skills available whenever there was a need. <br /><br /></div>
