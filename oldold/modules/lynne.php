<p><b>Tribute by Lynne Franco (Younger daughter), Elena and Lucio Franco (Grandchildren)</b></p>
<p>Donald Miller was all those things that others have said about him: an important contributor to the global world of 

science and to the local world of Livermore. He was also an important contributor to the growth and development of his 

daughters and his grandchildren. And this is what I would like to speak about.<br><br>
My father has influenced me in ways that I always recognized&sbquo; and in many ways that I had not recognized. Through 

example and lively discussions over the years&sbquo; I absorbed that what was important about being Jewish was not whether 

you believed in God or maintained the rituals - it was about being ethical - using Judaism&rsquo;s ethical standards to guide 

behavior. This perspective has allowed me to connect with my Jewish roots in a way that feels comfortable to me&sbquo; but 

does not push me away. Through his example and as embodied in the saying he would like on his headstone from the Pirkei Avot 

&quot;You are not required to complete the work&sbquo; but neither are you at liberty to abstain from it&sbquo;&quot; I have 

made my efforts to &quot;repair the world&quot; in the professional work I do&sbquo; although in a broader global community 

rather than a local one my father chose to focus on. <br><br>
My father led by example - he never pushed me to be like him (although we might argue for hours on any specific point of view 

and he always hoped he would have another practicing scientist in the house) - I always felt &quot;permission&quot; to create 

my life in my own way&sbquo; and that I was respected for my decisions.<br><br> 
Although he only had daughters&sbquo; we never felt if he longed for a son - he fostered an environment of equality&sbquo; 

mirroring his relationship with his wife&sbquo; giving us the sense that&sbquo; as girls&sbquo; the world was open to us and 

we could do anything. He treated us with respect&sbquo; and with our mother&sbquo; gave us responsibility and trusted us to 

use it wisely (and most of the time&sbquo; we did). <br><br>
The intensity of our interactions waxed and waned over the years&sbquo; as both his other engagements and mine waxed and 

waned. Yet&sbquo; he always stayed &quot;tuned in&quot; to what my sister and I were doing&sbquo; through my mother. They 

were a symbiotic team - Don and Miriam&sbquo; perhaps in all aspects&sbquo; but certainly as parents. There was never any 

possibility of getting around one by going to the other. When I was younger&sbquo; my father was heavily involved in local 

politics - and was either at a meeting or on the phone. As an adolescent&sbquo; I seemed to find ways to actively engage my 

father in areas of shared interest (and he engaged more than willingly) - convincing him to buy a bigger sailboat (a family 

boat) so that we could sail and race together and to buy a clavichord kit that we could and did build together. In my 

undergraduate and graduate school years&sbquo; we would have long talks when I came home. Then I moved to Africa for many 

years&sbquo; and we did not have as many opportunities to interact (before the era of email and skype). But we moved back 

into the same orbit when my children were born - my father&sbquo; who perhaps had not felt so comfortable in his skin about 

&quot;fathering for young children&quot;&sbquo; grew into his role as &quot;nonno&quot; (Italian for grandfather) with a bang 

and flourish. He sought out his grandchildren&sbquo; spent a year in Washington so that his 13 year old granddaughter could 

live with them for a year while we were still in Africa&sbquo; and created a space for a shared interest with his grandson 

around shooting&sbquo; hoping to teach him to work with precision on reloading as well as shooting.<br><br>
My children have their memories and thoughts about their grandfather. Elena and Lucio came up with a series of words that 

they associate with their &quot;nonno&quot; - smart&sbquo; patient&sbquo; knowledgeable&sbquo; intellectual&sbquo; 

stories&sbquo; loving&sbquo; caring&sbquo; stubborn&sbquo; very political&sbquo; loves dark chocolate&sbquo; married more 

than 60 years&sbquo; and &quot;don&rsquo;t get him started on things he likes&sbquo; or he will talk forever.&quot;
My father recently told us about growing up in his household&sbquo; about his father who was so intelligent&sbquo; hard 

working&sbquo; and accomplished in making the world a more just place - a father he had lost when he was just 17. My father 

spoke about how he had always hoped he could live up to all his father had done. I feel the same about my father - he has 

done so much for so many - but if I am going to live up to what he has accomplished&sbquo; I think I had better get cracking.
Finally&sbquo; I want to say to my father&sbquo; who&sbquo; as he was dying&sbquo; wanted so much to not 

&quot;disappear&quot; and be forgotten. For you I quote from Kahil Gibran &quot;To live in the heart of those we leave behind 

is not to die&quot; -- we will never forget you.</p>
