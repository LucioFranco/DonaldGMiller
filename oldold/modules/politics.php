<p><strong> Don  Miller and Local Politics</strong><br />
		Don first ran for City Council in  1962. He came in 5th out of 8 candidates. By 1968, he felt the time was right  to try again, and so six months before the election, he went to the editor of  the local newspaper, the Independent, Dana McGough, who had experience in  various successful campaigns. Dana&rsquo;s first question was, &quot;Do you know 100  people who will support you? If you find that support, I&rsquo;ll show you how to  win.&quot; Miriam and Don went to Carmel for the day, sat on the beach, and  made a list of 100 people they knew from Cask and Mask, the arts community, the  schools, neighbors, friends, etc. Then Don went home and called each one of  them. <br />
		<br />
		Don had been attending Council  meetings regularly for several previous years, often speaking out on issues he  cared about. The newspapers reported what was said, and so residents became  familiar with his vision for Livermore. He knew what kind of a city he wanted  to live in, and was always thinking about how to get there.<img src="/images/signs.jpg" width="288" height="203" alt="signs" style="float:right;padding-top:10px;padding-left:10px;"/><br />
		<br />
		A local candidate had recently been successful knocking on doors, and Don  decided to organize a large precinct campaign, which no one had done before in  Livermore. He limited contributions to $10 a person, and said he would not take  money from developers or the Chamber of Commerce. He won the election easily,  and four years later was voted in again by a large majority, helped in part by  hundreds of silk screened signs designed in black and white by Gloria Taylor, a  local artist. These signs were works of art and people saved them after the  campaign.  <br />
		<br />
		After his two Council terms, Don continued to attend and speak at Council  meetings as a citizen, and to promote his vision. <br />
		<br />
		<strong>Signs and Zoning</strong><br />
		<br />
		Don believed that people should be proud of how their city looked. By 1968, he  found there were signs everywhere downtown, each trying to outdo the next for  attention. He looked everywhere he went for models that would identify business  in a quiet way and that would be fair to all. Don&rsquo;s philosophy related to signs  was, &ldquo;When no one shouts, everyone can be heard.&rdquo; This was not popular with the  business community, and with great difficulty, he finally convinced a majority  of the Council to vote for the Sign Ordinance, which limits the size and  locations of signs.  Much of this still exists  today. <br />
		<br />
		He also wanted to change the zoning ordinance so that developers would have to  offer more than just 5000 sq. ft. lots. He believed cities where there was  plenty of land should not crowd people together just so developers could make  more money. This battle went on for many years, and Don slowly was successful  in developing a Residential Zoning Ordinance. <br />
		<br />
		<strong>Park Development</strong><br />
		<br />
		Another part of Don&rsquo;s vision for a livable city was neighborhood parks. This  fight was made more difficult because parks were handled by another agency  (LARPD) and the City had no role in parks. How to solve this? Don asked a  friendly Planning Commissioner to recommend that there be a deal whereby the  City would institute a Park Development fee to buy land, and LARPD would  operate the parks. He was ecstatic when the Council finally agreed. He did not  care that he got no credit for pushing this. He just wanted the parks, not the  glory. <br />
		<br />
		<strong>SAVE (Save All Valley Environments) <br />
		</strong><br />
				Livermore was growing so fast in the late 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s that it was running out  of sewers, and water, and the schools were on double sessions. The developers  were building houses at a great rate, and paid no attention to the resulting  problems. A small group of citizens, including Don, circulated an initiative  that said more houses could not be built until the sewer, water, and school  problems were solved. It was very controversial, but the Initiative won.  Developers took it to court, and went up the ladder, until the California  Supreme Court decided to let the Initiative stand. This has become a case that  is now discussed in California law schools. <br />
		<br />
		<strong>UGB (Urban Growth Boundary)</strong><img src="/images/zoned.jpg" width="103" height="134" alt="zoned" style="float:right;"/> <br />
		<br /> 
		To preserve open space, and to limit growth of Livermore to a sustainable  population, activists, including Don, developed an Initiative 10 years ago that  would draw a line beyond which no development could take place. It passed  overwhelmingly in spite of being outspent many times over. A County UGB was  also put place by a separate County wide vote. That Initiative also passed  easily.<br /> This means the UGB stands as law and can only be overturned by another  vote of the people. <br />

		<strong>Scenic Corridor</strong><br /><br /><img src="/images/realridgeling.jpg" width="248" height="128" longdesc="images/signs.jpg" style="float:left;padding-right:10px;padding-top:4px;"/>
		
		Don&rsquo;s vision for Livermore and the surrounding Valley included preserving the  beautiful hills surrounding the City. He believed promoting infill development  which would mean houses and businesses should be built within the City limits  and not disturb our hills. While an ordinance was ultimately passed, height  limitations were always an issue for compromise, and Don spent many Council  meetings trying to convince the Council that the hills were part of our  heritage worth preserving. Today, if you drive down hwy. 580, it is easy to see  where the Dublin hills end, and Livermore hills begin. </p>

<p align="center" id="donquotes"><strong>DON MILLER'S POLITICAL SLOGANS collected November 1997</strong></p>
<p align="center">(all with * are original with  DGM)</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>All generalizations (slogans) are false.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Gratuitous  Generalities</strong></p>
<p>* Cynicism and pessimism are the only  true guides to reality.</p>
<p>* In politics, a logical argument will  get you nowhere.</p>
<p>* Something good takes years of slogging  through quicksand;Anything rotten is done irreversibly  in a microsecond.</p>
<p>You can't win them all, or even  hardly any.</p>
<p>* Lose a few, lose a few.</p>
<p>The world is mean and man uncouth,  and sad to say I tell the truth.(Bertold Brecht, Three Penny Opera)</p>
<p>* In politics, if you let George do it,  don't bend over. (He will give you the shaft.)</p>
<p>Eternal vigilance is the price of  liberty.</p>
<p>There is an old political theory  which says that the people get precisely what they deserve.</p>
<p>* Greed is the most powerful of human  emotions, even more so than hunger or sex.</p>
<p>* If the public really understands the  issue, they will do the &quot;right&quot; thing almost every  time-----unless it involves bigotry; in which case they will do the  &quot;wrong&quot; thing every time.</p>
<p>* When large amounts of money are at  stake, &quot;good faith&quot;, &quot;honest&quot;, &quot;truth&quot;, and  &quot;trust&quot; are words utterly without meaning.</p>
<br clear="all" />
<p align="center"><strong>Philosophy and  Process</strong></p>
<p>* Public officials seldom act, they  react.</p>
<p>Politics is the art of compromise; but you never compromise if you don't  have to.</p>
<p>*Politics is the art of the  possible---but don't give up before you even start. (You can't stop growth if you start out by  conceding that growth can't be stopped.)</p>
<p>*Every question has two sides--but NOT  necessarily of equal weight.</p>
<p>*Whoever controls the first draft is 10  steps up the ladder.</p>
<p>*Whenever the details of a bad proposal  begin to be discussed, the cause is lost. (Therefore decide first whether it is good or  bad).</p>
<p>*Every public official should have a  tinge of paranoia. It is of course not true that every  applicant is out to screw the public. However if you make that assumption,  you will be right a hell of a lot more often than you will  be wrong.</p>
<p>*Monday night (meeting night) is masochism night.</p>
<p>*Personal survival in politics depends  on expecting to lose everything;any win is then pure, beautiful gravy.</p>
<p>The name of the game is 3  votes.  (More generally, Integer((n/2)+1) votes, where n is the number of board  members. For California cities, n=5.)</p>
<p>*The first motion often wins the day.  (Many people don't like to vote no.)</p>
<p>In politics, you reward your friends  and punish your enemies.Consequently if you find yourself  being punished by your &quot;friends&quot;,it is time to relabel who are friends  and enemies.</p>
<p>In politics you don't get mad, you  just get even.</p>
<p>&quot;No decision&quot; is itself a  decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br clear="all" />
<p align="center"><strong>Who Wins; Who Loses</strong></p>
<p>*Businessmen don't run the City like a business, they run it for business.</p>
<p>In most political decisions, the  powerful few make a bundle by taking small amounts out of the pockets of  the powerless many. (Harlan Zodtner)</p>
<p>*To most politicians, one businessman,  subdivider, or applicant is more important than 20,000 citizens.</p>
<p>*Consciously or unconsciously, most  public officials see themselves as judges and mediators between  applicants and their citizens. But they are elected to represent their citizens; let the courts be the judges.</p>
<p>*If politicians bend over backward to  be &quot;fair&quot; to an applicant, they are leaning away from their  constituents--and the community loses its rights.</p>
<p>*Developers planned (insert name of  city), not its council, planners, or citizenry.</p>
<p>*To watch local government deal with  land development issues is to view the continuous example of the  triumph of private greed over public need.</p>
<p>*In local politics, the lines are  usually drawn between the ineffective 90% of citizens who do their living in the city and the powerful 10% of businessmen,  developers, and politicians who make  their living from the city.</p>
<p>Citizens may be equal at the polls  where little is decided, but they are not equal at the bank teller's  wickets where much is decided.(Ferdinand Lundberg, America's 60  Families.)</p>
<p>Those who cannot remember the past  are condemned to repeat it. (Santayana)<p>
<p>*Those who cannot remember Los Angeles  or San Jose are condemned to repeat Los Angeles and San Jose.</p>
<p>*Contrary to popular opinion, many  public officials don't take money under the table.  However:1. Politicians can be corrupted by power, flattery, cocktail parties, and simply by  desire to associate with the rich.<p>
<p>2.  &quot;You cannot hope to bribe  nor twist,Thank God, the British journalist. But seeing  what the man will do Unbribed,  there's no occasion to.&quot;  (Humbert  Wolfe)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*If you poison someone's coffee with  cyanide, you are a vicious criminal. If you poison someone by  adding arsenic to his orange juice for six months, you are a  vicious criminal. If, on the other hand, your actions over a five year  period poison 150,000 people's water supply, poison their air with  smog, gridlock their streets and highways, and increase the per  capita crime rate, you are a "far sighted" developer or  politician. As such, you are to be commended for bringing  &quot;progress&quot; to your sickened victims, to be defended by newspapers from their  protests, and to be deserving of huge financial rewards.</p>
<p>*The ticket seller who deliberately  sells a 16th ticket to a person to ride down a 15 person elevator,  thereby sending all 16 hurtling to their deaths, is a vicious criminal.  The elevator operator that deliberately allows it to happen is a  criminal accomplice. In a smog ridden and traffic choked area where  population growth inevitably makes the situation worse, the  developer is the ticket seller and the City Council is the elevator  operator--even if the disaster occurs more slowly. The cases differ only in  degree, not in kind.</p>
<p>*Understanding the complicated world of  politics and politicians is simple, just FOLLOW THE MONEY.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>A Few More</strong></p>
<p>Winning is better than losing.</p>
<p>A man convinced against his will, is  of the same opinion still. Therefore replace him by electing  someone with the right gut reactions.</p>
<p>*A &quot;balanced&quot; board never  accomplishes a damn thing.  Therefore  elect a solid majority going the same  way.  (However unanimity often leads to mistakes--one opposition voice  keeps everyone honest.)</p>
<p>Someone has to care;  If you don't, who will?</p>
<p>*My father taught me that &quot;Justice  always triumphs,&quot; but I've found that it usually needs a lot of help.</p>
<p>*If every citizen of (insert name of  city) were condemned to attend six City Council meetings in a  row,  things would be a hell of a lot different and a hell of a lot  better.  (And most Council members would be recalled).</p>
<p>When in doubt, turn them out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
