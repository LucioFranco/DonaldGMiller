<div><b>Don and Family</b><br /><br /></div> 
<div>Don viewed &quot;family&quot; in a broad sense. His first family was his wife and two daughters who he adored. 

However&sbquo; his concept of family closely incorporated his grandchildren&sbquo; his close relatives as well as all the 

generations before him. He felt connected to them all. He loved stories about the previous generations&sbquo; and also wanted 

to know the latest about what was happening in the lives of those close to him. <br /><br />
He was happy when he could talk to each one individually&sbquo; but also he was satisfied if he only heard the details second 

hand&sbquo; usually in reports from Miriam. What he didn&rsquo;t like was to be left out of the family loop. <br /><br />
Don was not much interested in playing games except for poker which he taught his children and grandchildren.  His interest 

in sports was limited to swimming&sbquo; sailing&sbquo; and shooting. When asked what he did for fun. He usually 

answered&sbquo; &quot;My work is my fun!&quot; <br /><br /></div>
