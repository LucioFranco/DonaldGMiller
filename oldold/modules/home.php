Why this website? <br><br>
This website was the brainchild of Lucio Daniele Franco&sbquo; Don Miller&rsquo;s grandson&sbquo; based on a dual desire to pay tribute to the only grandfather he knew and to build his skills in website design. But it is also the collective effort of many individuals: Don&rsquo;s children&sbquo; his wife&sbquo; his colleagues and his friends. <br><br> 
This website offers us all an opportunity to collect and savor the accomplishments&sbquo; shared experiences and love that we all feel for Don Miller - husband&sbquo; father&sbquo; grandfather&sbquo; scientist&sbquo; activist&sbquo; elected politician&sbquo; musician and music lover&sbquo; Jew&sbquo; environmentalist&sbquo; and friend. This site belongs to all those who knew him. To quote Kahil Gibran &quot;To live in the heart of those we leave behind is not to die&quot; -- Donald G. Miller&sbquo; we will never forget you. <br><br> 
We invite you to browse through the various pages of this site and relish in the sides to Don Miller that you knew&sbquo; and discover other sides to him that perhaps you did not know. <br><br><hr>

  Livermore&rsquo;s numerous parks, undeveloped hillsides,  fountains, charming downtown with cultural spaces, and lack of distracting  signs are just a few of the testimonials to Donald Miller&rsquo;s civic  activism. He fought against unlimited development, seeking to protect the area&rsquo;s air, water, open space and natural  beauty.</p>
