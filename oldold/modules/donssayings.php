<p><strong>Don Miller and his Sayings</strong></p>
<p>For those who spent time with Don Miler, you know that he had many phrases that he used frequently. Some of these are scrolling across the top of the site. In 1975,  Don's  two daughters, Nancy and Lynne, began to collect these saying. For Don's 50th birthday in 1977, they presented him with a hand-made leather bound book, entitled <em>A Conversation with Don Miller, </em>with almost 100 sayings printed in caligraphy, one per page, accompanied by photographs. For Don's 60th birthday, they &quot;re-&quot; presented the book to him again, with additional sayings they had forgotten the first time. In 1997, for his 70th birthday, they added a few more.  At that point there were no more pages in the book. </p>
