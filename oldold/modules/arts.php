<p><strong>Don and the Arts</strong><br>
		Don believed that music, art, drama, and other cultural activities helped make citizens proud of their community.

		Soon after arriving in Livermore, he joined the Community Concert Association to help bring musical programs to the City.  Ten years later, in 1966, Don and four other activists wanted to generate more public support for the arts.  They submitted a proposal to the City and the Parks District to look into the formation of an Arts Council. A simple idea, which immediately created political uproar.  What agency should be in charge, would independent groups be required to join, would taking public money mean public control of the arts?  The activists decided to stay in the background as much as possible.  The time was right, and in a few months the Livermore Cultural commission was set up.  Don served on the Board for the over fifty years.

<p><strong>Music</strong></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;s particular interest was in bringing music events to Livermore.  He joined the Board of Del Valle Fine Arts, which succeeded the Community Concerts Association.  For fifty years, they brought a wide variety of world class concerts to town.  They arranged for many of their artists to visit the schools and provided students with low cost tickets to the concerts.</p>

		1969 was Livermore&rsquo;s Centennial.  Requests went out for a piece of music in honor of the City.   Don, who had never written music, although he had played the piano and the harpsichord for many years, decided to give it a try.  His piece, Centennial Rag, became the official music.  A copy is buried in the container of city artifacts in Centennial Park. Don went on to write two more rags: Nostaliga Rag in 1971 and Political Rag in 1975, dedicated to the Independent Newspaper. <br /><br />

<p>In the 1973, Don's daughter Lynne, who wasa 15 at the time, decided that the two of them should build a clavichord from a kit, and Don thought it would be really great to have a clavichord. As Don told the story, Lynne built the cabinetry, Don strung the clavichord, and Miriam did the finishing. As was his custom, Don read the instructions to the kit in great detail before he would let Lynne pick up a tool to start, even though Lynne had already figured it out right away. But she waited patiently until Don was ready to move ahead.
